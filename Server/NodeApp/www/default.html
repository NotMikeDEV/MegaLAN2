		MegaLAN is a peer to peer VPN client for creating adhoc Virtual LANs.
	</p>
	<p class="subtitle">
		Users can create private or public LANs. Users can then join these networks within seconds.
		Virtual LANs appear as a virtual network interface, which simulates an extra ethernet connection between devices.

	<p class="subtitle">
		Do you need to use an application that only works between hosts on the same LAN? File Sharing, Gaming, Media Streaming, etc.
	</p>
	<p class="subtitle">
		Many older games require that users be on a shared LAN for local multiplayer functionality, sometimes using protocols such as IPX.
	</p>
	<p class="subtitle">
		These applications will operate over MegaLAN without users needing to set up their own servers or coordinate creating connections to each other using potentially dynamic IP addresses.
		MegaLAN should be suitable for most scenarios where a direct LAN connection is needed between multiple users over the Internet.
